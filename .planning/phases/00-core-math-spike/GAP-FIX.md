# Phase 0 — Sampler Correctness Gap Fix

Plan 00-07's exit-criteria sweep paused at the human-verify checkpoint. The user caught
real correctness bugs in the sampler/bounds math. A `gsd-debugger` run produced the diagnosis
below; the user reviewed and approved it. This document is the single entry point for the
executor that applies the fix.

## User-reported ground truth

| Attachment | Current sampler output | User expected |
|------------|------------------------|----------------|
| CIRCLE/CIRCLE (mesh) | scale 2.388, PATH @ f0 | scale **2.0**, PATH @ f0 |
| SQUARE/SQUARE (region, TransformConstraint) | scale 2.103, PATH @ f0 | scale **1.5**, PATH @ f0 |
| SQUARE2/SQUARE (region on pre-scaled bone) | scale 0.607, PATH @ f40 | scale **0.46**, PATH @ **f20** |
| TRIANGLE/TRIANGLE (region on chain tip) | scale 2.916, PATH @ **f58** (impossible — PATH has 50 frames) | scale **2.0**, PATH @ f0 |

Invariant the user verified in the editor: CIRCLE and SQUARE should achieve the **same** peak
scale in both PATH and SIMPLE_SCALE animations (because CHAIN_2 is stepped to scale=2 at t=0
in both animations). Current output respects this invariant — values are wrong **in unison**,
not mismatched.

## Root causes (approved)

### RC1 — Scale formula conflates rotation with scale

`src/core/bounds.ts` `computeScale(aabb, sourceDims)` returns
`max(worldAABB_W / sourceW, worldAABB_H / sourceH)`. For an attachment on a bone with world
rotation θ, the AABB widens by `|cos θ| + (h/w)·|sin θ|` (up to `√2` at 45° for a square).
The formula reads rotation as extra scale.

Evidence: setup-pose AABB scales (Physics.pose, no animation applied):

| Attachment | slot bone | bone world rotation (setup) | AABB/source | max(worldScaleX, worldScaleY) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CIRCLE | CTRL | 0° | 1.000 | 1.000 |
| TRIANGLE | CHAIN_8 | ~35° | **1.445** | 1.000 |
| SQUARE | SQUARE (constrained) | ~22° | **1.303** | 1.000 |
| SQUARE2 | SQUARE2 | 0° (bone scale 0.2538) | 0.350 | 0.2538 |

TRIANGLE and SQUARE show inflation BEFORE any animation runs — pure rotation artifact.

### RC2 — CLI Frame column uses display rate, not editor fps

`src/core/sampler.ts:99` hardcodes `frameRate = 60` for the `frame` field in PeakRecord.
Animators cross-reference their editor dopesheet (fps = 30 per Spine default, since
SIMPLE_TEST.json has no top-level `fps` field). TRIANGLE's `t = 0.9667s × 60 = 58` is
impossible as an editor frame (PATH is 50 editor frames); `0.9667s × 30 = 29` is the real
editor frame.

CLAUDE.md rule 1 forbids fps from driving **sampling**. It does NOT forbid reading it for
**display**. The existing hygiene grep `expect(src).not.toMatch(/skeleton\.fps/)` in
`tests/core/sampler.spec.ts:335` is a misreading of that rule and must be relaxed.

## Approved fix

### Formulas

**Region attachments:**
```
peakScaleX = |slot.bone.getWorldScaleX()|
peakScaleY = |slot.bone.getWorldScaleY()|
peakScale  = max(peakScaleX, peakScaleY)
```

**Mesh (VertexAttachment) attachments — weighted per-vertex:**
```
for each vertex V with bones [b₀, b₁, …] and weights [w₀, w₁, …]:
  vx = Σᵢ wᵢ · |bᵢ.getWorldScaleX()|
  vy = Σᵢ wᵢ · |bᵢ.getWorldScaleY()|
peakScaleX = max over vertices of vx
peakScaleY = max over vertices of vy
peakScale  = max(peakScaleX, peakScaleY)
```

**Non-textured attachments** (BoundingBox, Path, Point, Clipping): return `null` (unchanged).

### UX decision (locked by user)

PeakRecord carries `peakScale`, `peakScaleX`, `peakScaleY` separately:
- `peakScale = max(peakScaleX, peakScaleY)` drives resize decisions (bigger side as norm).
- `peakScaleX` / `peakScaleY` are informational — the future UI will display them so users
  can see max-X and max-Y at the peak frame/animation.

This also unblocks the "aspect-ratio anomaly" flag in ROADMAP.md Deferred.

### Editor fps plumbing

- Add `editorFps: number` to `LoadResult` in `src/core/types.ts`.
- In `src/core/loader.ts`, set `editorFps = skeletonData.fps || 30` (silent default — matches
  Spine editor's own default).
- In `src/core/sampler.ts`, use `editorFps` (not a hardcoded 60) for `frame = Math.round(t * editorFps)`.
- Remove `frameRate` from `SamplerOptions` (or keep as an override if precedent for overrides
  already exists; default must come from `editorFps`).

### File change budget (~125 LOC)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/core/bounds.ts` | Add `computeRenderScale(slot, attachment): { scale, scaleX, scaleY } \| null`. Keep `attachmentWorldAABB` (Peak W×H column still uses it). Retire the scalar `computeScale` (new function supersedes it — delete or mark `@deprecated`). |
| `src/core/sampler.ts` | Swap `computeScale` call for `computeRenderScale`. Populate `peakScale`/`peakScaleX`/`peakScaleY` on PeakRecord. Read `editorFps` from `LoadResult` for the `frame` field. |
| `src/core/loader.ts` | Populate `editorFps = skeletonData.fps \|\| 30` in the returned LoadResult. |
| `src/core/types.ts` | Add `editorFps: number` to `LoadResult`. Update `PeakRecord` to carry `peakScale`, `peakScaleX`, `peakScaleY` (the old single `scale` field is renamed / augmented). |
| `scripts/cli.ts` | Keep "Peak W×H" column (AABB-based). "Scale" column now reads `peakScale`. No new columns required in this phase — the UI reveal of scaleX/Y is a future-phase concern. |
| `tests/core/sampler.spec.ts` | Relax hygiene grep: replace `/skeleton\.fps/` with `/dt\s*=.*fps\|samplingHz\s*=.*fps/`. Add numeric goldens (see below). |
| `tests/core/bounds.spec.ts` | Add `computeRenderScale` tests (Region + Mesh + skip list). |

### Required new golden tests

All assertions use `fixtures/SIMPLE_PROJECT/SIMPLE_TEST.json`:

- CIRCLE peak scale within 1e-3 of **2.0** in PATH.
- CIRCLE peak scale within 1e-3 of **2.0** in SIMPLE_SCALE.
- CIRCLE PATH peak equals SIMPLE_SCALE peak within 1e-3 (invariant).
- SQUARE peak scale within 1e-3 of **1.5** in PATH.
- SQUARE peak scale within 1e-3 of **1.5** in SIMPLE_SCALE.
- SQUARE PATH peak equals SIMPLE_SCALE peak within 1e-3.
- TRIANGLE peak scale within 1e-3 of **2.0** in PATH (expect @ f0, but test the value not the
  frame — minor FP drift may shift the exact peak time by <1 tick).
- SQUARE2 peak scale within 1e-3 of **0.4604** in PATH.
- SQUARE2 peak editor-frame equals **20** in PATH (asserts the editor-fps plumbing).
- For each peak record, `frame == round(time * 30)` for this fixture (editor-fps = 30 default).

### Test the sampler does NOT sort regressions

- `npm test` — full suite must stay green after the hygiene grep relaxation.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — strict compile must stay green.
- `npm run cli -- fixtures/SIMPLE_PROJECT/SIMPLE_TEST.json` — re-capture the table for the
  next human-verify checkpoint.

## Expected CLI table after the fix

```
Attachment         Skin     Source W×H  Peak W×H       Scale  Source Animation  Frame
-----------------  -------  ----------  -------------  -----  ----------------  -----
CIRCLE/CIRCLE      default  699×699     1397.9×1400.4  2.000  PATH              0
SQUARE/SQUARE      default  1000×1000   1500.0×1500.0  1.500  PATH              0
SQUARE2/SQUARE     default  1000×1000   460.4×460.4    0.460  PATH              20
TRIANGLE/TRIANGLE  default  833×759     1666.0×1518.0  2.000  PATH              0
```

Exact Peak W×H values may vary slightly — the column still uses the AABB, so it will reflect
actual rotated-quad bounds. The "Scale" column is what must match user expectations.

## Resume sequence

1. `/clear` (or open a fresh session).
2. Point the fresh Claude at this file: read `.planning/phases/00-core-math-spike/GAP-FIX.md`
   plus the debug session at `.planning/debug/phase-0-scale-overshoot.md`.
3. Apply the fix across the 7 files above. Commit atomically:
   - `fix(00-core): render-scale formula (replaces AABB/source ratio that conflated rotation with scale)`
   - `fix(00-core): CLI Frame column uses editor fps from skeletonData.fps (default 30)`
   - `test(00-core): numeric goldens for CIRCLE/SQUARE/SQUARE2/TRIANGLE peak scales and editor frames`
   - `docs(00-07): close gap — render-scale + editor-fps fix`
4. Re-run the CLI and capture output.
5. Present the re-captured table to the user (new human-verify checkpoint on Plan 00-07).
6. On approval: finish Plan 00-07 (SUMMARY.md, STATE.md, ROADMAP.md update), then proceed
   with the normal phase-close gates (code review, schema drift, regression, verify phase).

## Out of scope for this fix

- Renaming `attachmentWorldAABB` or `computeScale` beyond the surgical retire-the-scalar-only
  change. Keep the AABB column working — animators use it for layout.
- Any UI work (Phase 1+).
- Adaptive bisection around candidate peaks (deferred per ROADMAP.md).
- `.skel` binary loader.

## Confidence

- RC1 (render-scale formula): 95%+ — 3/4 ground-truth rows match `max(bone.worldScaleX, worldScaleY)` exactly; setup-pose evidence shows rotation inflation before any animation runs.
- RC2 (editor fps plumbing): 98%+ — arithmetic verifies (0.9667s × 30 = 29, 0.6667s × 30 = 20 for SQUARE2 f20).
- Mesh formula (weighted per-vertex): 85% — defensible, aligns with spine-core's own weighting math, but alternative measures (max edge-length ratio, per-vertex Jacobian singular value) were considered and rejected as less principled.
